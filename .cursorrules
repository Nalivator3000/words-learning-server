# Critical Rules for All AI Agents

⚠️ **BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, READ `.clinerules` FILE!**

## Absolute Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS):

1. **NEVER** push to `main` branch - ONLY use `develop`
2. **NEVER** test locally - ONLY test on Railway production
3. **NEVER** suggest local testing or local database operations
4. **ALWAYS** read `.clinerules` file before starting any task

## Git Commands:
- ✅ ALLOWED: `git push origin develop`
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: `git push origin main`
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: `git push` (without explicit branch)

## Testing:
- ✅ ALLOWED: `npm run test:e2e:production:smoke` (Railway)
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Any local testing commands
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Local database connections

## Why:
- This project has NO local database setup
- Railway auto-deploys from `develop` branch
- `main` branch is production-only
