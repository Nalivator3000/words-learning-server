## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Railway Build Strategy
**Problem**: Railway Docker doesn't install devDependencies, causing tailwindcss build to fail.

**Solution**:
- Separated build scripts: `npm run build` (production, no CSS) vs `npm run build:local` (includes CSS)
- Pre-built CSS locally and committed `tailwind-output.css` to repo
- Moved build-critical tools (terser, html-minifier-terser) to dependencies
- Kept tailwindcss in devDependencies (only needed for local dev)

**Result**: Railway now builds successfully without needing tailwindcss.

### Store Assets Strategy
**Automated Generation**:
- Feature graphic: Sharp + SVG generation
- Screenshots: Puppeteer automation (requires test data)
- Icons: Already complete (9 sizes + maskable)

**Benefits**:
- Reproducible builds
- Easy updates/regeneration
- Consistent branding
- Version control friendly

   - Pre-build static assets when possible (CSS, images)
   - Test deployment early and often

2. **PWA Best Practices**:
   - Commit manifest.json, service-worker.js to repo
   - Include maskable icons for Android adaptive icons
   - Set correct viewport meta tags for mobile

3. **Documentation Approach**:
   - Comprehensive guides reduce manual work later
   - Automation scripts pay off quickly
   - Clear checklists prevent missed tasks
