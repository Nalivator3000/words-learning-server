## Implementation Notes

### English-Specific Considerations

1. **Irregular Verbs**
   - Prioritize common irregular verbs in A1-A2
   - Include past tense and past participle forms
   - Group by pattern where possible

2. **Phrasal Verbs**
   - Start introducing in A2
   - Expand significantly in B1-B2
   - Include separable/inseparable distinctions

3. **Articles (a/an/the)**
   - Systematic teaching from A1
   - Special focus for Russian speakers (no articles in Russian)
   - Context-based examples

4. **Prepositions**
   - High priority (difficult for Russian speakers)
   - Extensive practice examples
   - Common collocations

5. **False Friends**
   - Identify English-Russian false cognates
   - Magazine ≠ магазин (magazine vs store)
   - Actually ≠ актуально (actually vs currently)
   - Family ≠ фамилия (family vs surname)

6. **Pronunciation Notes**
   - Include phonetic transcription
   - Mark stress patterns
   - Note common pronunciation mistakes

7. **British vs American English**
   - Indicate variants where significant
   - Focus on American English as primary
   - Note common British alternatives

### Example Entry Format

```
| English | Russian | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| the book | книга | I read the book yesterday. | article + noun; /ðə bʊk/; stress on "book" |
| to go (went, gone) | идти, ехать | I go to school every day. | irregular verb; goes/went/gone |
| look forward to | с нетерпением ждать | I'm looking forward to the weekend. | phrasal verb + prep.; +gerund |
```

### Priority Focus Areas

1. **Articles & Determiners** - Critical for Russian speakers
2. **Verb Tenses** - 12 main tenses vs 3 in Russian
3. **Prepositions** - Different usage patterns
4. **Word Order** - SVO strictly enforced
5. **Phrasal Verbs** - No direct equivalent in Russian
6. **Gerunds & Infinitives** - Complex rules
7. **Modal Verbs** - Nuanced meanings
